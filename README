This is the code of OntoSpider and Literature Crawler, as they were proposed 
in the student thesis:
http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/student-theses/2008-0110-201308/UUindex.html

The thesis was largely theoretical, the code is not fully functional yet and
only gives an idea of how the approach that is proposed in the thesis could
be implemented.

This code is on github in case others would like to examine it or even work on it.
For the time being, the author will be busy with totally different things.
